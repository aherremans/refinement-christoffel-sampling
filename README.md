# Refinement-Based Christoffel Sampling

MATLAB implementation of **refinement-based Christoffel sampling** (`rcs`) for least squares approximation in non-orthogonal bases. This repository includes all examples from the paper:

*"Refinement-based Christoffel sampling for least squares approximation in non-orthogonal bases"*

by Astrid Herremans and Ben Adcock.

## Features

- `rcs`: General MATLAB function for refinement-based Christoffel sampling.
- Ready-to-run examples from the paper.
