% returns coordinates of points clustering to the curve parameterized by f_curve.
% f_curve is a 2D function handle vanishing at the singularity curve
% N_tangent is the number of points along the curve
% N_normal is the number of clustering points in the normal direction
% dom = [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] is the domain size
% Optionally, threshold specifies how close the points can be to the curve.
